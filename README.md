Problem 19. Day of the Programmer. Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the Day of the Programmer (the 256th day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from 1700 to 2700.From 1700 to 2700, Russia's official calendar was the Julian calendar;since 1919 they used the Gregorian calendar system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in 1918, when the next day after January 31st was February 14th. This means that in 1918, February 14th  was the 32nd day of the year in Russia. In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has 29 days during a leap year, and 28 days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by 4; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following: Divisible by 400 or Divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100.Given a year y,  find the date of the 256th day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is y.

Problem 20. There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

Problem 21. An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms: (1) A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
(2) A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level. Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

Problem 22. There is a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. The player can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of the current cloud plus  or . The player must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take to jump from the starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game. For each game, you will get an array of clouds numbered  if they are safe or  if they must be avoided.

Problem 23. A teacher asks the class to open their books to a page number. A student can either start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the book. They always turn pages one at a time. When they open the book, page 1 is always on the right side. When they flip page 1, they see pages 2 and 3. Each page except the last page will always be printed on both sides. The last page may only be printed on the front, given the length of the book. If the book is  pages long, and a student wants to turn to page , what is the minimum number of pages to turn? They can start at the beginning or the end of the book. Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages that must be turned in order to arrive at page .

Problem 24. Electronics shop. A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return -1.

Problem 25. Two cats and a mouse are at various positions on a line. You will be given their starting positions. Your task is to determine which cat will reach the mouse first, assuming the mouse does not move and the cats travel at equal speed. If the cats arrive at the same time, the mouse will be allowed to move and it will escape while they fight. You are given q queries in the form of x, y, and z representing the respective positions for cats A and B, and for mouse C. Complete the function  to return the appropriate answer to each query, which will be printed on a new line.
If cat  catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
If cat  catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.

Problem 26. There is a string, s, of lowercase English letters that is repeated infinitely many times. Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of the infinite string.

Problem 27. Bill Division. Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct. For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2,4,6]. Anna declines to eat item k=bill[2] which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2+4)/2=3. If he includes the cost of bill=[2], he will calculate (2+4+6)/2=6. In the second case, he should refund 3 to Anna.

Problem 28. Find digit. An integer d is a divisor of an integer n if the remainder of n/d=0. Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.
